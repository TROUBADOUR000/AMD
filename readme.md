# Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition Framework for Time Series Forecasting

[![arXiv](http://img.shields.io/badge/cs.LG-arXiv%3A2406.03751-B31B1B.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03751)

## Overview
The Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition Framework (AMD) is a cutting-edge solution for time series forecasting, incorporating three main components: the Multi-Scale Decomposable Mixing (MDM) Block, the Dual Dependency Interaction (DDI) Block, and the Adaptive Multi-predictor Synthesis (AMS) Block.

## Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you are using Python 3.9. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation
Download the required datasets from [Autoformer](https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer) and [iTransfomer](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer). Organize the data in a folder named `./data` as follows:

```
data
├── electricity.csv
├── exchange_rate
├── ETTh1.csv
├── ETTh2.csv
├── ETTm1.csv
├── ETTm2.csv
├── solar_AL.txt
├── traffic.csv
└── weather.csv
```

## Training Example
All training scripts are located in the `./scripts` directory. To train a model using the weather dataset, run the following command:

```bash
./scripts/Weather.sh
```
